### Base Problem

You are given three APIs:

API 1 â€“ Returns a list of user objects (with id fields).

API 2 â€“ Given a user id, returns the cart id for that user.

API 3 â€“ Given a cart id, returns the list of products in that cart.

Task

Fetch the data from these APIs in the correct order:

First, get the user id(s) from API 1.

Then, use that id to get the corresponding cart id(s) from API 2.

Finally, fetch the cartâ€™s products using API 3.

Ensure that all calls for multiple users/carts are handled efficiently.

Display the final result in a structured format (e.g., a list of users with their cart products).

Follow-Ups (Level by Level)
Level 1 â€“ Error Handling

Handle cases where any of the API calls fail (network error, invalid id, empty result).

Ensure that partial data doesnâ€™t break the whole flow.

Level 2 â€“ Performance

Instead of making calls one by one, optimize the fetching of cart ids and product data when multiple users exist.

Level 3 â€“ UI Integration

Build a simple UI where:

Clicking a button triggers the data fetching sequence.

While data is loading, show a loading indicator.

Once loaded, display user â†’ cart â†’ products in a hierarchical way.

Level 4 â€“ Advanced Enhancements

Add a retry mechanism for failed API calls (retry up to 3 times before showing an error).

Add a cancel mechanism (user clicks cancel before all requests complete).

Paginate the product list if it is large.

ðŸ‘‰ This way, youâ€™ll first solve the core chaining & Promise.all problem (the original JPMC question), and then push yourself into error handling, optimization, UI, and robustnessâ€”exactly the kinds of things an SDE-2 interviewer might probe deeper into.

### The rule of thumb for dependency arrays

- Always include everything your function/effect touches from the outside scope: props, state, or other callbacks.

- If something is constant or wrapped in another useCallback/useMemo with stable deps, you can safely skip extra dependencies.
